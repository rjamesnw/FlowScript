# FlowScript #

FlowScript is a visual programming language (VPL) used for build client and server applications using a browser. It is built using TypeScript and NodeJS. FlowScript started under the name CircuitScript around 2010, but was later renamed to FlowScript in 2014 within a private repo during the prototype phase.  It is now being release in alpha (still a WIP) on GitHub as of Oct 30, 2018.

### Version ###

* Version: Alpha
* [FlowScript Site](https://flowscript.org) *(Not live; WIP)*

### How do I get set up? ###

* Visual Studio Code is used as the IDE, and TypeScript as the "language" platform.
* To setup a new VS Code environment you can run `install_extensions.cmd`.
* Dependencies for development: NodeJS, NPM, nodemon (`install -g install nodemon`)
* Don't forget to run `npm install` from the command line within the workspace path to restore the required node modules.
* Database configuration: MySQL v(TBD)+
* How to run tests: At the moment, simple tests are being run by loading the path at `Source\ide\scripts\tests\simple\index.html` in the browser. Since the `ide` folder is the web root, the page can be loaded at `http://localhost:8080/scripts/tests/simple`.
* Deployment instructions: You run the NodeJS server project (the config called `Launch Server`) to serve the project's site and handle server side flow scripts. A simple browser is all that is needed to run the website on the client side (`http://localhost:8080/`).

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Writing tests: 
* Code review: I will review all pull requests.
* Other guidelines: 
    1. All code must be documented using JSDoc comments.  That means all class, functions, properties, etc.  The code within the function bodies should have blank lines and comments separating ideas.  Since many other developers may have to work on your code/changes, it can be hard to understand the reasoning for any quirks that may be related on conditions not immediately apparent in the current context, or simply just because if a particular conviction.

        Make sure to document the parameters as well, such as `@param {string} value  ...description...`.
    
        If I cannot read the comments and immediately understand what is going on, I will most likely reject the pull request.

    2. Naming conventions are strict, but simple: 
        1. All functions and properties must be in typical JS notation (camel case, such as "myPropOrFunc"), and without underscores (in most cases). 
        2. All private properties or functions on a class must be prefixed with an underscore (example: "_myPrivatePropOrFunc").
        3. All types are in Pascal case (example: "MyClassType").
        4. All interfaces are in Pascal case, and start with "I" (example: "IMyCoolInterface").

    3. No jQuery or any other library in the VPL system or runtime. The system must be stand alone and without any dependency on other libraries.  While the system is VPL, it still needs to be low level for maximum speed efficiency (especially where the runtime is involved). This also applies to code generated by core system components and FlowScript component libraries.  3rd party components and/or libraries are free to make whatever dependencies within their own code-component JS scriptlets.

    4. No modules. Everything compiles into a single script and loads as such.
